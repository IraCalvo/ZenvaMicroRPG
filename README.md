Class Game

This game is a simple top down game where the player can move and explore the land and collect loot. This game features:
-WASD Movement
-Event systems to do certain actions
-health bar that the player has so it'll detect if hit or not
-XP Bar
-Interactables like a chest and a door
-Tile palettes

This game was one of the first games to introduce me to top down map making, I personally really loved it.
